notes

Nice animation for alert system
Order should be Pending/Doing/Done
Doesn't enforce a linear progression - Do some more mockups
Experiment with color of application
Maybe easy way of showing how many tasks?
Combine in a single toggle(Rethink new button, Reposition Me and All toggle, Way to see all members of project, Other actions)
Ipad/tablet mockup

Order should be Pending, Doing, Done



Change arrow in Pending list



New button is too big



Change Me/App toggle position - maybe have an action bar at the bottom



Keep consistent color scheme



Where do I see member/collaborators on a project



What's the desktop/tablet view



Add # of tasks
